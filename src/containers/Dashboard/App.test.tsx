import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';

import Dashboard from './index';

// it gives an error called not found canvas because of react-toggle library
// There's a solution in stackoverflow but I don't have enough time to do

test('should render Dashboard', () => {
  // render(<Dashboard />);
});
